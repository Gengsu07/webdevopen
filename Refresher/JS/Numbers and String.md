## **Two Main Kinds of Data Types**

There are two kinds of data types in JavaScript:

1.  **primitives** or **primitive values** and
2.  **objects** or **non-primitive values**.

> According to MDN, a primitive (a.k.a. primitive value or primitive data type) is **any data that is not an object and has no methods**.

This being said, in JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types:

- number,
- string,
- boolean,
- null,
- undefined,
- symbol (latest added in ECMAScript2015)

We will come back to the concept of immutability but, for now, keep in mind that **all primitive data types are immutable**.

This video would be a good start to understand primitives and non-primitives.

Let's talk a bit about numbers as data types üî¢

## **A number as data type**

Using numbers, we can represent **integers** and **floating-point numbers** in JavaScript.

```
const age = 34;
const price = 12.99;
```

Number as a data type also supports **special numeric values**: **NaN** and **Infinity**. We really don't have to go in details here but **NaN** is something that you'll see throughout this course so let's explain a bit.

**NaN** stands for **Not a Number** and it represents a **computational error**. It is a result of incorrect mathematical operation, such as:

```
const name = 'Sandra'; // &lt;== string data type
const whatIsThis = name / 2;

console.log(whatIsThis); // ==&gt; NaN
```

_NaN_ is not a normal number, although it belongs to this data type. If you get _NaN_ and you expected to get a number after some mathematical operation, you are probably performing the operation on a string or some other data type that isn't a number.

### **Number expressions**

If you're familiar with math or other sciences, the term operator is well known to you. When we're doing basic addition, in the example 2 + 2, + is the operator, and the operation executed here is addition.

Let's recap some basic math operations:

- \+ addition
- \- subtraction
- \* multiplication
- / division

### **Advanced Operators**

**Exponentiation**

In math, there is a very useful concept called [exponentiation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Exponentiation.html). Exponentiation is the process of taking a quantity b (the base) to the power of another quantity e (the exponent).

In JavaScript, we can easily use exponentiation by using the \*\* (exponentiation) operator:

```
console.log(2 ** 5);
// 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
// =&gt; 32
```

**  
Modulo  
**

Modulo (%) is the remainder operator. Think of this as saying _If I divide the first number by the second, what is the remainder?  
_

This is very handy for finding multiples of a particular number, and many other use cases:

---

**  
Assignment Operators**

Previously we learned how to assign values to variables. We use **\=** sign to do this. To make sure we are all on the same page:

> The basic assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x. (source: [Assignment operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment_Operators))

Very commonly used assignment operator is += and here is an example of how to use it:

```
let myAge = 25;

myAge += 1;
console.log(myAge);
```

+= is the equivalent of saying myAge = myAge + 1. Adding myAge and 1 on its own _does not_ change the value of myAge, it simply adds the two together and returns you the value computed. (**Remember this when we talk about immutability a bit later in the lesson.**)

---

### **Expressions**

An expression is a combination of any value (number, string, array, object) and set of operators that result in another value.

So we can say that the following is an example of an _expression_:

```
2 + 4;
```

And this is its correspondent [parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree):

_Take number two and add four to it._

Another example is this:

```
const result = (7 + 5) / 3 - 8;
console.log(result);

// =&gt; -4
```

- Take the number 7, add it to 5
- Divide this new value by 3
- Take that value and then subtract 8
- Assign that value to **result**

It seems JavaScript knows in what order to put the numbers together. How does it do this? Well it literally follows the basic mathematic rules - let's refresh our memory.

---

### **Operator Precedence**

> In mathematics and computer programming, the order of operations (or operator precedence) is a collection of rules that define which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate a given mathematical expression.

Expressions in math have a particular order in which they get evaluated, based on the operators they use.

2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 _2 = 6 (2 + 2)_ 2 = 8

As we said, in JavaScript, the same as in math, we have to follow **PEMDAS** rules.

In the numerical order, anything that comes first will be executed first (**1** for **Parentheses**, **2** for **Exponents**, etc.), meaning that anything in parentheses will be executed first, exponents second, multiplication third,

```
const i = 10 + (5 * 2 ** 3) / 4 - 6;
//  === 10 + 5 * 8 / 4 - 6 &lt;== start with the exponents (2 ** 3)
//  === 10 + 40 / 4 - 6 &lt;== then multiplication (5 * 8)
//  === 10 + 10 - 6 &lt;== then division (40 / 4)
//  === 20 - 6 &lt;== then addition (10 + 10 )
//  ==&gt; 14 &lt;== and finally finish with subtraction (20 - 6)
```

You can find a list of these operators and the order in which they are executed [here at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

## **A string as data type**

### **What is a string?**

A string is simply **a sequence of characters**. A character can be a letter, number, punctuation, or even things such as new lines and tabs.

### **Creating a String**

To create a string in JavaScript you have to use one of these **quotes**:

- "" double quotes,
- '' single quotes or
- \`\` backticks (grave accents).

There's no real difference between double and single quotes, so it is a matter of preference. **Backticks**, however, have **"extra" functionality**. Using backticks, we are actually creating **template literals**.

> ‚úÖ **Template literals** are string literals allowing embedded expressions.

Strings in JavaScript have been historically limited. [ES6 Template Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) introduces an entirely different way of solving these problems.

```
let greeting = `Yo, Root Learn!`;
```

One of their first real benefits is **string substitution**. Substitution **allows us to take any valid JavaScript expression and place it inside a template literal, and the result will be output as part of the same string**.

In simple English, using backticks we can **embed variables and expressions inside the strings**. Template strings can contain placeholders for string substitution using the **${ } syntax**, as demonstrated below:

```
let name = 'Ana';
console.log(`Hello there, ${name}!`);
// ==&gt; Hello there, Ana!

console.log(`${name} walks every day at least ${1 + 2} km.`);
// ==&gt; Ana walks every day at least 3km.
```

**ES5 Old-school style!!**

```
var customer = { firstName: 'Foo', lastName: 'Kim' };
var message = 'Hello ' + customer.firstName + ' ' + customer.lastName + '!!';
console.log(message);
```

**ES6 Interpolation style!!**

```
let customer = { firstName: 'Foo', lastName: 'Kim' };
let message = `Hello ${customer.firstName} ${customer.lastName}!!`;
console.log(message);
```

As you can see, this kind of interpolation using template literals makes our code much more readable and cleaner!

---

### **Multiline Interpolation**

Another great functionality of backticks is being able to easily add **new lines** in the same string (meaning the string can span multiple lanes):

```
const fruits = `
1. banana
2. apple
3. orange
4. cherry
`;

console.log(fruits);
// 1. banana,
// 2. apple,
// 3. orange,
// 4. cherry
```

As we can see, each fruit is on its own line. With other kinds of strings that would cause a syntax error.

**Special characters**

Some strings are special because they contain special characters. This means that we have to use **escape sequences** to make everything work.

For example, when you want to have double quotes in the middle of your string (sentence), you will have to use some "magic" üé©.

```
const favBook = "My favorite book is "Anna Karenina".";
console.log(favBook); // &lt;== error: Unexpected token
```

If you can use single quotes, no problem:

```
const favBook = "My favorite book is 'Anna Karenina'.";
console.log(favBook); // &lt;== My favorite book is 'Anna Karenina'.
```

If you, however, for some reason have to use double quotes, your way around this would be using **backslash escape** character.

```
const favBook = 'My favorite book is "Anna Karenina".';
console.log(favBook); // &lt;== My favorite book is "Anna Karenina".
```

The same applies for apostrophes inside single quote strings:

```
const mood = "I'm OK.";
console.log(mood); // &lt;== I'm OK.
```

> So, to conclude, you should use \\ (backslash) when there's a need to escape a special character in a string

It's still possible to create **multilane strings** with double or single quotes but with the help of "new line character" \\n.

> ‚≠ê You can see a full list of these special characters at the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Using_special_characters_in_strings).

**  
String length**

**.length** is a numeric property of a string.

```
const name = 'Ana';
console.log(name.length); // &lt;== 3
```

### **Methods for string manipulation**

Manipulating and modifying strings in code are common operations. Simple things such as capitalizing a name, or checking to see if a word starts with some letter are very common.

JavaScript includes a **String library of methods** to simplify some of the most common tasks on strings. Let's look at how to perform some of these operations.

---

**Adding To Strings**

We can easily concatenate or add characters to strings with the + or += operator.

**  
Accessing characters**

One of the ways to access the characters inside the string is using **charAt(n)** method.

> **charAt(n)** shows the character on the nth position in the string but keep in mind, the first character is indexed with zero (0).

```
const greeting = 'Hello there!';
console.log(`"${greeting}" is a string and it's length is ${greeting.length}.`);
// "Hello there!" is a string and it's length is 12.
console.log(greeting.charAt(0)); // &lt;== H
console.log(greeting.charAt(1)); // &lt;== e
console.log(greeting.charAt(5)); // &lt;== " "
console.log(greeting.charAt(11)); // &lt;== !
console.log(greeting.charAt(12)); // &lt;== "" as an empty string
```

We can also access characters inside of strings with square brackets and their **index** number. As we said, the index **starts at 0**.

```
const greeting = 'Hello there!';
console.log(greeting[0]); // &lt;== H
console.log(greeting[3]); // &lt;== l
console.log(greeting[9]); // &lt;== r
console.log(greeting[-2]); // undefined
```

---

**Finding a substring**

JavaScript has a cool **.indexOf(substr)** method that returns the index where a particular character/substring occurs. If the substring was not found, it returns -1.

```
const message = "Don't be sad, be happy!";
console.log(message.indexOf("Don't")); // &lt;== 0
console.log(message.indexOf('t')); // &lt;== 4
console.log(message.indexOf('Be')); // &lt;== -1 (capitalized Be ‚â† lowercased be)
console.log(message.indexOf('py')); // 20
```

The substring be appears more than once. To see the next occurrence, we need to tell somehow our .indexOf() method to skip the first one.

```
const message = "Don't be sad, be happy!";
console.log(message.indexOf('be')); // &lt;== 6
console.log(message.indexOf('be', 7)); // &lt;== 1
```

What we did was passing a second parameter, which represents a value where the first occurrence appeared (it was 6) + 1. So we are telling the method to skip the positions from 0 to 7 and keep looking for the occurrence of the first parameter (in our case: _"be"_).

If we need to look for a substring but from the end to its beginning, you can use **str.lastIndexOf(substr)**. It shows occurrences in the reverse order.

```
const message = "Don't be sad, be happy!";
console.log(message.lastIndexOf('be'));
// The index of the first "be" from the end is 14
```
